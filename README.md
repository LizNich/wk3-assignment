Cookie Clicker Assignment

What requirements did I achieve?
-Event listeners
-Use of local storage
-Use of SetInterval
-A game that updates totals

from the stretch goals:
-linked to the API (see (arrayworkings.js)).  
-Improved UX with clickable images for buttons and a neat display of options and game status

Were there any requirements or goals that I was unable to achieve?
-I needed to tidy my code to include functions.

What did I find difficult about these tasks?
-If I was adding more Functions I'd need to think about this much earlier in the process. I've left a note in (functionsworkings.js).
API to show I have accessed the API but I've not linked the data into the game. I focussed on providing the completed assignment hoping to go back to the array workings once I had a submission completed hitting the requirements. I'll go back to this when I can to learn how to do this though.
-I could do with understanding again how to make this work on different media. I used a grid-box for the main table and this, and the background picture, looks awful on a mobile at the moment.
