Cookie Clicker Assignment

What requirements did I achieve?
My cookie clicker has the following:
Event listeners
Use of local storage
Use of SetInterval
A game that updates totals

from the stretch goals:
linked to the API (see (arrayworkings.js)).  
Improved UX with clickable images for buttons and a neat display of options and game status

Where there any requirements or goals that I was unable to achieve?
I needed to tidy my code and include functions.

from the stretch goals:
Using data from the API for the game.

if so, what did I find difficult about these tasks?
If I was adding more Functions I'd need to think about this much earlier in the process. I've left a note in (functionsworkings.js).
API - I've not linked the data into the game. I focussed on providing the completed assignment hoping to go back to the array workings once I had a submission completed hitting the requirements. I'll go back to this when I can to learn how to do this though.
I could do with understanding how it works on diffent media. I used a grid-box for the main table and this, and the background picutre, looks awful on a mobile at the moment.
