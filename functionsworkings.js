// if I was adding more functions I'd need to think about this much earlier in the process

//However, with regard to the code I think I could add the following
function updateDisplay() {}
//for   cookieDisplay.textContent = xxx

function updateStorage() {}
//for localStorage.setItem("xxx", xxx);

// I think there should also be one for the impact of purchasing upgrades also to store the +cps impact
